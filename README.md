# specter-x

A Clojure library designed to extend specter to support data structures.


## Usage

The specter <https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter> library has very nice support for extracting pieces of arbritary complex clojure data structures.

This library extends it by macros and functions to support the **_exploration_**  of such data structures.
